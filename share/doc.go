/*
Package share contains logic related to the retrieval and random sampling of shares of
block data.

Though this package contains several useful methods for getting specific shares and/or
sampling them at random, a particularly useful method is GetSharesByNamespace which retrieves
all shares of block data of the given Namespace from the block associated with the given
DataAvailabilityHeader (DAH, but referred to as AxisRoots within this package).

This package also contains declaration of the Availability interface. Implementations of
the interface (light, full) are located in the availability sub-folder.
Light Availability implementation samples for 16 shares of block data (enough to verify
the block's availability on the network).
Full Availability implementation samples for as many shares as necessary to fully reconstruct
the block data.
